# allChat

The project [allChat](https://github.com/PorYoung/allChat) is one of components of project [hifi_wechat](https://github.com/PorYoung/hifi_wechat) which based on nodejs `express` frame, `wechat SDK` and `socket.io`. In this project I rewrite it with [egg.js](https://eggjs.org/), added some new features and optimized. I only spend 3 days to re-construct the project, maybe there are many problems remained. If you find any bugs, wish you can concat me or help me fix it. Thanks!.

You might need to know [egg.js](https://eggjs.org/) and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) first.

## QuickStart

<!-- add docs here for user -->

It's easy to start allChat on your computer. Please notice that my nodejs version is `8.9.0`.

1. Fetch allChat.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/PorYoung/allChat.git
```
2. Go to the project directory and install dependencies.
```
$ npm i
```
3. You might need use `webpack-cli` to build static files.
```
$ npm i webpack-cli -g
$ npm run build
```
4. run egg.js project
```
$ npm run dev
```
5. Don't forget the database which I used [mongodb](www.mongodb.org/), install it and start it directly, the connection configuration is in `config/config.default.js`. It's `egg-mongoose` here, which help you use [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) in egg app.
```javascript
config.mongoose = {
  client: {
    url: 'mongodb://127.0.0.1/chat',
    options: {},
  },
};
```


see [egg docs][egg] and [webpack docs](https://webpack.js.org/concept) for more detail.

- `config`: egg app configuration, see [egg Configuration](https://eggjs.org/en/basics/config.html) for more detail.
- `log`: log files.

### some dependencies

- `socket.io`: websocket frame, *FEATURING THE FASTEST AND MOST RELIABLE REAL-TIME ENGINE*, [see its website](https://socket.io/).
- `egg-mongoose`: use mongoose in egg.
- `egg-ejs`: use `ejs` to render html file.
- `bootstrap`, `jquery` and other the third part plugin for web front pages, and `underscroe` can be removed when you replace `_.compile()` with `${}`.
- etc.

### other tips
